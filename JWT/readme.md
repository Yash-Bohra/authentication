# JWTs

JWTs, or JSON Web Tokens, are a compact and self-contained way to represent information between two parties. They are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications.

**JWTs are Stateless**: JWTs contain all the information needed to authenticate a request, so the server doesnâ€™t need to store session data. All the `data` is stored in the token itself.

# Codebase

hit "npm i jsonwebtoken" in terminal to install dependecies

# V1

after signing up the frontend also shows the user details by reffering the cuurent JWT token stored in localStorage of the browser
